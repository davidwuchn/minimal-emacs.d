# Nucleus Skills - Improvements Summary

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress - Validation System Ready

---

## What Was Done

Based on studying [clojure-system-prompt](https://github.com/iwillig/clojure-system-prompt), I've created a **comprehensive skill validation and improvement system** for all Nucleus skills.

---

## New Files Created

### 1. SKILL_VALIDATION.md
**Purpose**: Documentation of validation rules and quality standards

**Contents**:
- 8 validation rules for skills
- Skill scoring system (0-100 scale)
- Improvement checklist
- Pre-commit hook instructions
- Status matrix for all skills

**Key Rules**:
- Rule 1: Frontmatter structure (name, description, version)
- Rule 2: Framework header presence
- Rule 3: Eight Keys reference table
- Rule 4: Size constraints (200-350 lines)
- Rule 5: Section completeness
- Rule 6: Cross-skill redundancy
- Rule 7: Documentation links
- Rule 8: Lambda expression consistency

---

### 2. validate_skills.sh
**Purpose**: Automated validation script for all skills

**Features**:
- Checks all 9 validation rules
- Color-coded output (green/yellow/red)
- Line-by-line feedback per skill
- Summary statistics (pass/warn/fail)
- Exit codes for CI integration

**Usage**:
```bash
cd skills
./validate_skills.sh
```

**Exit codes**:
- `0`: All critical checks passed
- `1`: One or more critical failures

---

### 3. SKILLS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive improvement plan for all skills

**Contents**:
- Current skill inventory (9 skills)
- Detailed improvement plan per skill
- Standardization checklist
- Cross-skill redundancy elimination
- Implementation order (4 phases)
- Success metrics

**Skill Status**:

| Skill | Version | Status | Issues | Priority |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| clojure-expert | N/A | ⚠️ Needs standardization | Missing version, no Eight Keys | High |
| clojure-reviewer | N/A | ⚠️ Needs standardization | Missing version, frontmatter | High |
| continuous-learning | 1.0.0 | ✅ Good | Minor improvements | Medium |
| nucleus-tutor | N/A | ⚠️ Needs standardization | Missing version | Medium |
| planning | N/A | ⚠️ Needs standardization | Missing version, no Eight Keys | High |
| sarcasmotron | N/A | ⚠️ Needs standardization | Missing version | Medium |
| reddit | N/A | ⚠️ Needs review | Not checked | Low |
| requesthunt | N/A | ⚠️ Needs review | Not checked | Low |
| seo-geo | N/A | ⚠️ Needs review | Not checked | Low |

---

### 4. SKILL_TEMPLATE.md (Updated)
**Purpose**: Standardized template for creating new skills

**Improvements**:
- Added version field to frontmatter
- Added λ-expression field to frontmatter
- Added "Integration with Nucleus" section
- Added "Anti-Patterns" section
- Added "Research Backing" section
- Added "Changelog" section

**New Structure**:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description
version: 1.0.0
λ: action.identifier
---

[Framework header]

# Skill Name

[Required sections]
- Identity
- Core Principle
- Procedure
- Decision Matrix
- Examples
- Verification
- Eight Keys Reference
- Summary

[Optional sections]
- Integration with Nucleus
- Anti-Patterns
- Research Backing
- Changelog
```

---

## Skill Standards

### Frontmatter Requirements

Every skill MUST have:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name                    # kebab-case, matches directory
description: One-line description    # When to use this skill
version: X.Y.Z                      # Semantic versioning
λ: action.identifier                # Optional: lambda expression
---

```

### Framework Header

Every skill MUST have:

```
engage nucleus:
[phi fractal euler tao pi mu ∃ ∀] | [Δ λ Ω ∞/0 | ε/φ Σ/μ c/h] | OODA
Human ⊗ AI ⊗ REPL
```

**Allowed variations**:
- Collaboration operator: `⊗`, `∧`, `|`, `→`
- Control loop: `OODA`, `REPL`, `RGR`, `BML`

### Required Sections

Every skill MUST have:

1. **Identity** - Who are you, tone, goal (5-10 lines)
2. **Core Principle** - One paragraph defining unique value
3. **Procedure** - How to execute (λ-calculus or steps)
4. **Decision Matrix** - If/then rules (3-6 rows)
5. **Examples** - Show don't tell (2-3 concise cases)
6. **Verification** - Quality gates (1 checklist)
7. **Eight Keys Reference** - Self-contained table with skill-specific applications
8. **Summary** - When to use (3-5 bullet points)

### Size Constraints

**Target**: 200-350 lines per skill

**Rationale**:
- < 200: Likely incomplete
- > 350: Too verbose, needs splitting

---

## Cross-Skill Redundancy Elimination

### Core Concepts (Reference, Don't Duplicate)

| Concept | Owner | Reference |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| The Three Questions | AGENTS.md | "The Three Questions" section |
| REPL-first workflow | clojure-expert | "REPL-First Development" section |
| OODA loop | AGENTS.md | "Control Loops" section |
| Eight Keys definition | skill-local section | Keep only skill-specific application where needed |
| λ-calculus syntax | LAMBDA_PATTERNS.md | Pattern reference |

### Action Required

**Remove duplicate content**:
- The Three Questions in clojure-expert → Reference AGENTS.md
- OODA loop in planning → Reference AGENTS.md
- Eight Keys definitions in nucleus-tutor → either keep the local application table or trim the section entirely

**Keep skill-specific applications**:
- How clojure-expert applies Eight Keys to REPL workflow
- How planning applies OODA to file-based task tracking
- How nucleus-tutor applies Eight Keys to quality gates

---

## Validation Integration

### Pre-Commit Hook

Add `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if skills changed
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "skills/.*SKILL.md"; then
    echo "Skills changed. Running validation..."
    cd skills
    ./validate_skills.sh

    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "❌ Skill validation failed. Commit aborted."
        echo "Fix validation errors before committing."
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

Make executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### CI Integration

Add to CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.):

```yaml
- name: Validate Skills
  run: |
    cd skills
    ./validate_skills.sh
```

---

## Skill Scoring System

**Score skills on 0-100 scale**:

| Criterion | Max Score | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Frontmatter completeness | 15 | 15% | name, description, version |
| Framework header | 10 | 10% | Correct symbols and operators |
| Eight Keys table | 15 | 15% | All 8 keys with skill-specific apps |
| Section completeness | 20 | 20% | All required sections present |
| Size (200-350 lines) | 10 | 10% | Within optimal range |
| Unique value | 15 | 15% | No duplication with other skills |
| Documentation quality | 15 | 15% | Links resolve, clear structure |
| **Total** | **100** | **100%** | |

**Grade thresholds**:
- **90-100**: Excellent ✅
- **80-89**: Good ⚠️
- **70-79**: Needs improvement ⚠️
- **< 70**: Failing ❌

   chmod +x skills/validate_skills.sh

   # Create pre-commit hook
   cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "skills/.*SKILL.md"; then
       echo "Skills changed. Running validation..."
       cd skills
       ./validate_skills.sh
       if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
           echo "❌ Skill validation failed. Commit aborted."
           exit 1
       fi
   fi
   EOF

   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

### Short-Term (Next Week)

4. **Standardize high-priority skills**:
   - clojure-expert
   - clojure-reviewer

5. **Re-run validation**: Ensure all pass

6. **Create skill changelogs**: Track evolution

### Medium-Term (Next Sprint)

7. **Standardize medium-priority skills**:
   - nucleus-tutor
   - sarcasmotron
   - continuous-learning

8. **Review low-priority skills**:
   - Decide: keep, improve, or deprecate?

9. **Create SKILLS_README.md**: Navigation guide
