## Targets with Validation Failures

These targets may need different research patterns or the research findings were misleading.

- `lisp/modules/gptel-auto-workflow-strategic.el` (5 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-auto-workflow-projects.el` (1 kept / 5 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-tools-agent-error.el` (1 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-tools-agent-prompt-build.el` (1 kept / 2 failed)

## Allium Behavioral Coherence

*3 behavioral issues (severity 0.00). EXTRACTED from Allium v3 pipeline.*



## Meta-Learning Recommendations (INFERRED — from pattern analysis)

- **This strategy underperforms.** Consider evolving a new approach.
- The findings may be too generic or targeting the wrong files.
- Try combining with git history for recency bias.


























































































































































































































































































































## Allium Behavioral Spec (auto-generated, v3)

*3 check issues (severity 0.00). EXTRACTED from distill→check pipeline.*

```allium
<think>
The user wants me to distill the research strategy output. Let me analyze what's provided:

1. Research strategy: "template-default"
2. 84 experiments across targets (files)
3. Kept hypotheses: empty list (mostly blank lines)
4. Discarded hypotheses: also empty, with "- No hypothesis stated" and one about improving `gptel-auto-workflow-list-project-buffers`

This seems like a fragment of a research session output. The user likely wants me to:
1. Summarize what this means
2. Perhaps help them structure or understand this data
3. Or create a proper distillation/memory

Let me provide a clear, concise distillation of what this research strategy summary shows.
</think>
```

### Check Issues

## Research Strategy Distillation

**Strategy:** `template-default`  
**Scope:** 84 experiments across target files

### Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| **Kept hypotheses** | 0 |
| **Discarded hypotheses** | 1+ |

### Analysis

This appears to be a **largely exploratory** research session with:

1. **No stated hypotheses** — Most discarded entries are empty, suggesting experiments were run without formal hypotheses (common in initial discovery phases)

2. **One explicit discarded hypothesis:**
   - *Improve `gptel-auto-workflow-list-project-buffers`* — Noted as discarded, likely deemed unnecessary or out of scope

3. **Template-driven approach** — Using a default template suggests systematic, structured experimentation rather than ad-hoc exploration

### Interpretation

```
Strategy Type: Template-based systematic exploration
Hypothesis Discipline: Low (no formal hypotheses stated)
Iteration Density: High (84 experiments)
Filtering Strictness: Unknown (insufficient data on "kept" experiments)
```

**What would you like me to help with?**

- 📊 **Expand** this into a full research memory/log format
- 🔍 **Analyze** the discarded hypothesis for follow-up opportunities  
- 📋 **Reframe** into structured next steps or action items
- ❓ Something else?
