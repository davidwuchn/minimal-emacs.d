## Targets with Validation Failures

These targets may need different research patterns or the research findings
were misleading.

- `lisp/modules/gptel-auto-workflow-strategic.el` (1 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-auto-workflow-projects.el` (6 kept / 2 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-benchmark-principles.el` (1 kept / 6 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-auto-workflow-mementum.el` (1 failed)

## Meta-Learning Recommendations (INFERRED — from pattern analysis)

- **This strategy underperforms.** Consider evolving a new approach.
- The findings may be too generic or targeting the wrong files.
- Try combining with git history for recency bias.

```allium
# Distillation: Template-Default Strategy Results

## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total experiments | 157 |
| Targets explored | 25 |
| **Kept hypotheses** | **2** |
| Discarded hypotheses | 1 |

## Kept Hypotheses (2)

1. **No explicit hypothesis stated** — One experiment lacked an articulated hypothesis (passes through by default).
2. **Improving `gptel-auto-workflow-list-project-buffers`** — The only substantive kept finding, targeting the `lisp/modules/` namespace.

## Discarded Hypotheses (1)

- *Removal would change semantics for users depending on the function* — Counterargument: re-evaluating scope; the referenced behavior is not load-bearing for the template-default strategy.

## Observations

- **Very low yield**: 157 experiments distilled to a single actionable signal (1.3% kept rate by unique hypothesis).
- **Target concentration**: `lisp/modules/` files dominate (22 of 25 targets), with `staging-*` targets making up the remainder — none yielded kept hypotheses.
- **Single actionable direction**: the function `gptel-auto-workflow-list-project-buffers` is the only concrete target for improvement.
- The "no hypothesis" kept entry suggests the template-default strategy may be auto-accepting trivially-passing cases without requiring an explicit hypothesis statement.

## Recommendation

Given the thin output, consider tightening the strategy so experiments without an explicit hypothesis aren't auto-kept, and focus future runs on the `staging-*` targets which produced no kept signals.
