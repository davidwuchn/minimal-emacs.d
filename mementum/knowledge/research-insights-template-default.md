## Targets with Validation Failures

These targets may need different research patterns or the research findings were misleading.

- `lisp/modules/gptel-workflow-benchmark.el` (1 kept / 6 discarded / 6 failed)
- `lisp/modules/nucleus-tools.el` (6 kept / 14 discarded / 3 failed)
- `lisp/modules/nucleus-tools-validate.el` (5 kept / 10 discarded / 1 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-tools-agent.el` (8 kept / 22 discarded / 4 failed)
- `lisp/modules/gptel-benchmark-core.el` (20 kept / 31 discarded / 5 failed)

## Meta-Learning Recommendations (INFERRED — from pattern analysis)

- **This strategy underperforms.** Consider evolving a new approach.
- The findings may be too generic or targeting the wrong files.
- Try combining with git history for recency bias.
