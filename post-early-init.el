;;; Commentary:
;; This file is loaded after early-init.el but before init.el.
;; Use it for early configuration that must be set before packages are loaded.

;;; Code:

;; Set tree-sitter grammar directory early, before any tree-sitter modes are loaded
;; Note: user-emacs-directory is already set to var/ by pre-early-init.el
